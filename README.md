* Implemented card shuffling logic using Fisher-Yates algorithm:

```
  for (let i = array.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
    const j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));
    const temp = array[i];
    array[i] = array[j];
    array[j] = temp;
  }
```
* User highscore is saved in local storage, allowing users to keep track of their best scores and compete against themselves over time.
* Responsive on mobile
